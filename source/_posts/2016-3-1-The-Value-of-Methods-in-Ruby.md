The Value of Methods in Ruby

At first, writing methods seemed like a waste of time when writing code because it was not apparent when it could be used. It took time to understand when it works at its best.  Using chipotle orders as an example will help illustrate a methods use. Say chipotle has a deal in select stores: buy two burritos, get one free. If a customer partakes in this deal, three individual burrito orders will be processed. Previously, when doing one burrito order, a hash was used to store each response. But when interacting with a user on terminal and asking for responses, it is essential to have code that can correctly direct a customer through their order. Why type the same puts commands and gets commands three times or more when we can call on a method? That is what makes methods special. As codes get more complex and longer, methods save the programmer time and energy, making the whole code more efficient and easier to read.
	
When using the methods approach while programming, method commands like def(Define) are important.
