The growth mindset described in the Allison Kaptur’s blog post is incredible. This article has an appreciation for how people respond to incentives. I view a constructivse programming approach as one that includes hard work and a desire to learn. Programming is open ended and it allows people to put their creative energy into something that can be instantly shared with others. Mark Zuckerberg’s initial ideas for Facebook were brilliant and contributed a lot to his success as a founder. However, his perseverance and drive to make Facebook the company that it is now brought Facebook to be a huge success. His experimentation with the site and his consistent effort has made it iconic of the 2000’s. The stock market rise from $17.73 a share to $110.65 a share barely begins to exhibit the success of his creation. Mark’s creativity and unrelenting effort have brought Facebook to where it is today.

The other piece of Kaptur’s blog that resonated with me was the fixed mindset that leads people to worship their heroes so vigorously that they don’t believe they can be more like their heroes. I admire Elon Musk, an entrepreneur who co-created PayPal and leads Tesla and Spacex. He is brilliant and his success comes from the work he puts in to making his products better. If I work as hard as Elon Musk does now, I am confident that I too can do great things. However, there have been times when I did not believe I could ever be like Elon because of his overwhelming work ethic. Yet, as I reflected more on what makes Elon so special, I realized that his effort and enthusiasm for his work are two things that I can emulate. Musk taught him self rocket science by reading and applying himself. He did not wake up one morning and simply know what to do; his work ethic brought him to a deep understanding that helps him lead Spacex. I want to be like Elon Musk and I can be like him. My growth mindset will allow me to be like Elon.
